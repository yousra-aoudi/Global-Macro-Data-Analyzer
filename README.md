# Global-Macro-Data-Analyzer
The Global Macro Data Analyzer is a Python project that aims to provide an intuitive and flexible tool for analyzing global macroeconomic data. The project provides tools for loading, preprocessing, visualizing, and modeling data from a variety of sources, including financial data from stock exchanges, economic data from government agencies, and alternative data sources such as Twitter and Reddit. The data can be used to identify trends and patterns in the data and generate insights for managing risk and maximizing returns.

Getting Started

To get started with the project, first ensure that you have the following software installed:

Python 3
Required libraries (pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, statsmodels, yfinance, alpha_vantage, tweepy, praw)
pip freeze > requirements.txt
Next, clone the project repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/username/global-macro-data-analyzer.git

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

The project provides a GlobalMacroDataAnalyzer class that can be used to load, preprocess, visualize, and model data from various sources. 

Here's an example of how to use the class to analyze data from Yahoo Finance:

from GlobalMacroDataAnalyzer import GlobalMacroDataAnalyzer

analyzer = GlobalMacroDataAnalyzer('yahoo', 'AAPL', 'Close')
analyzer.load_data('yahoo')
analyzer.preprocess_data()
analyzer.explore_data()
analyzer.build_model()
analyzer.generate_recommendations()

In the example above, we create an instance of the GlobalMacroDataAnalyzer class and specify the data source ('yahoo'), the ticker symbol ('AAPL'), and the target variable ('Close'). We then load the data from Yahoo Finance, preprocess the data to handle inconsistencies and missing data points, explore the data using time series plots, build a linear regression model to identify trends and patterns in the data, and generate recommendations based on the insights and findings from the analysis.
